This house was next to a vacant lot. Well, the lot was vacant of a house, though it was home to a stray cat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew the (human) neighbor prior to moving in, and on Sundays we would grill out behind his house on his large stone/brick grill. One particular Sunday we were visited by a momma cat and a few feral kittens. These adorable baby animals were very shy, and would run if you stood up. But hunger quickly overcame shyness, and they would eat any scraps you threw to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the next few Sundays a cautious trust was established between the cats and us. One little black kitten in particular was hardly shy at all. This one black kitten caught my eye, and I made up my mind to \u201crescue\u201d it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week or two later, I have the day off work, and I\u2019m hanging out at my house in my pajama pants and a t-shirt. I had a busy day planned of playing video games and grilling meat. I step out on my front porch and fire up my grill. Before I\u2019m done cooking, my little visitors show up for a free meal. Only this time the mother is nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now is my chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I place a \u201cbread crumb\u201d trail of cat treats from the stairs to up the porch to where I\u2019m standing. Leading the way is the little black kitten. Ninja fast I grab my new little kitten.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then it happens\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My last lucid thought was that my cat, Retzen, was about to have a new playmate. That thought quickly changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moment I touched this kitten (read: demon), it screams with a bloodlust howl never heard before by human ears. This howl empowers/buffs the kittens surrounding me and instantly they fluff up super saiyan style to twice their size. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is no kung-fu movie; they do not wait and attack me one at a time. They are as relentless as (fluffy) zombies, and never give me a moments rest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One minute I\u2019m grilling chicken. The next I have a severely lacerated forearm from a screaming kitten who has now morphed into a (still screaming) misengineered blender with the blades on the outside. Not only that\u2026 I\u2019m being climbed, cut, clawed, pounced, ripped, bitten, scraped, scratched,  mangled and eviscerated by a half dozen of its siblings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here I am, a full grown male in his 20\u2019s and I\u2019m being felled by mere claw and fur weighing half a pound each. So I go on the defensive. \nI tuck in the tiny, black, demon kitten with my right hand, so he can\u2019t get away. With my left hand free, I start swatting away the other kittens attacking/climbing/besieging my legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had I planned this ahead of time, I would have worn some sort of armor. Alas, this day my only armor is a thin pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would have this much trouble from a kitten. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Struggling for freedom, my captured kitten lands his killing blow.

It bit my dick.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "While in college, I lived in a house that I rented (with a few other roommates). This house was next to a vacant lot. Well, the lot was vacant of a house, though it was home to a stray cat. \n\nI knew the (human) neighbor prior to moving in, and on Sundays we would grill out behind his house on his large stone/brick grill. One particular Sunday we were visited by a momma cat and a few feral kittens. These adorable baby animals were very shy, and would run if you stood up. But hunger quickly overcame shyness, and they would eat any scraps you threw to them.\n\nOver the next few Sundays a cautious trust was established between the cats and us. One little black kitten in particular was hardly shy at all. This one black kitten caught my eye, and I made up my mind to \u201crescue\u201d it.\n\nA week or two later, I have the day off work, and I\u2019m hanging out at my house in my pajama pants and a t-shirt. I had a busy day planned of playing video games and grilling meat. I step out on my front porch and fire up my grill. Before I\u2019m done cooking, my little visitors show up for a free meal. Only this time the mother is nowhere to be seen.\n\nNow is my chance.\n\nI place a \u201cbread crumb\u201d trail of cat treats from the stairs to up the porch to where I\u2019m standing. Leading the way is the little black kitten. Ninja fast I grab my new little kitten.  \n\nAnd then it happens\u2026\n\nMy last lucid thought was that my cat, Retzen, was about to have a new playmate. That thought quickly changed.\n\nThe moment I touched this kitten (read: demon), it screams with a bloodlust howl never heard before by human ears. This howl empowers/buffs the kittens surrounding me and instantly they fluff up super saiyan style to twice their size. \n\nThen they attack.\n\nThis is no kung-fu movie; they do not wait and attack me one at a time. They are as relentless as (fluffy) zombies, and never give me a moments rest. \n\nOne minute I\u2019m grilling chicken. The next I have a severely lacerated forearm from a screaming kitten who has now morphed into a (still screaming) misengineered blender with the blades on the outside. Not only that\u2026 I\u2019m being climbed, cut, clawed, pounced, ripped, bitten, scraped, scratched,  mangled and eviscerated by a half dozen of its siblings. \n\nHere I am, a full grown male in his 20\u2019s and I\u2019m being felled by mere claw and fur weighing half a pound each. So I go on the defensive. \nI tuck in the tiny, black, demon kitten with my right hand, so he can\u2019t get away. With my left hand free, I start swatting away the other kittens attacking/climbing/besieging my legs.\n\nHad I planned this ahead of time, I would have worn some sort of armor. Alas, this day my only armor is a thin pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would have this much trouble from a kitten. \n\nStruggling for freedom, my captured kitten lands his killing blow. Tucked like a football, and drenched in my own blood, he wiggles free enough to bite what would normally be a pair of jeans. Oddly enough, this was the kitten\u2019s lucky day. Rather than biting my leg, he grabs hold of my manhood through my pajama pants. \n\nI now know this cat is pure, unadulterated evil. \n\nIt is now my turn to let out a howl of my own as I pull off the kitten still dangling by its teeth from my lower extremity. Once free of the circumcising beast, I chase the kittens off my porch, and run inside to tend my wounds. \n\nThe kittens were never seen again\u2026\n\n(Side note:  How fast can you google what to do on the off chance a feral kitten teeth-pierces your Glans while currently bleeding from both of your forearms and hands?)\n\n(tldr: I went to grab a kitten.

He was heavy built, and wore a leather biker vest. He did not seem the type to feel guilty about shanking you on the street. \n  He bought a few items, but had beer. I of course ID him, and he shows it to me, and I total everything. He pulls out a check book, and writes a check. The check had a basket of kittens on it, and this seemed like one of those facebook posts of bikers look mean, but have a heart of gold type things.

Thank you guys, so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a shit-load of comments, and it&amp;#39;s pretty late; I fully intend on reading what everyone has to say, as well as getting back to everyone, but I&amp;#39;m about to pass out, so I&amp;#39;ll be back tomorrow [morning].  Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holy crap, guys, I never expected Buster to get this much exposure.  Man\u2026 if he only knew how much attention he was getting, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it would blow his little kitty brain.  You guys have donated $363.07 already (as of (9:51 PM EST)!  I&amp;#39;m trying to be careful to watch it \u2014 if it goes much higher, I&amp;#39;m taking down the link, as I would honestly feel absolutely awful if more was donated than the costs of fixing him up\u2026.  I know there&amp;#39;s more that goes into just initially fixing-him-up, like having him neutered, vaccinated, and whatever else.  This is already more than enough to re-coup what my girlfriend and I spent last night at the vet and getting supplies for him \u2014 food, a litter box, etc. \u2014 as well as much of what I know is to come.  Thank you guys so, so much; Redditors, you are beyond awesome!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of now, I&amp;#39;m just going through the posts, replying as I can.  Obviously, there are a shit-load of comments, and I&amp;#39;m reading them all and commenting with all the effort and sincerity I usually apply, even when I don&amp;#39;t have a couple hundred more to read and potentially reply to.  Honestly, it&amp;#39;s the very least I can do to give all of you who have given me your time, consideration, and thirty-nine (!) people who have also given some of their money.  So, to everyone, including those who chipped in a couple bucks along with notes saying they wish they could do more, I greatly, greatly appreciate it, beyond what words I can muster\u2026 thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for updates on Buster\u2026 well, &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/kBBXZ.jpg\"&gt;he&amp;#39;s asleep here on my lap&lt;/a&gt;, purring up a bloody storm.  He&amp;#39;s learned very quickly what we intend him to use the litter box for, has been eating voraciously, and is really just as awesome of a kitten/cat as anyone could ever want.  I&amp;#39;ve updated pictures in the album, so you can see for yourself.  As you can probably very easily understand and believe, my girlfriend (and I admit, myself) are getting attached to him, as much as I tried not to.  Truth is, I&amp;#39;ve always been a cat guy, as I had a cat (only pet I&amp;#39;ve ever had) growing up who died of lymphoma when I was 13, and I&amp;#39;ve really wanted a cat for at least the past 7 years.  My girlfriend is in a semi-similar boat, except her parents have 3 old cats and her brother rescued two kittens (sisters) last year, so naturally, we&amp;#39;re doing everything we can to find a place for Buster where we can still see him often.  My roommate isn&amp;#39;t yielding, and as it&amp;#39;s her place and she is allergic, I&amp;#39;m not pressuring her and respecting her decision.  My girlfriend however\u2026  she&amp;#39;s pressuring her roommates, and they&amp;#39;re actually growing more and more receptive of the idea of him staying there, but it&amp;#39;s still seemingly a temporary provision.  She is highly allergic to cats, too, so he probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed upstairs, but at least the three of us could stay together.  I understand how this potentially changes circumstances, and as such I&amp;#39;d be more than willing to refund any donations given under the premise that I&amp;#39;d be helping this kitten out, then passing him on to another home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, if anyone has any more questions or comments to leave, don&amp;#39;t hesitate to do so*, but I need to play DD for a friend in about ten minutes, so I won&amp;#39;t be around to continue commenting/replying for a little while.  I will get to everyone though; I&amp;#39;m in disbelief of the generosity for the sake of this little kitten \u2014 $491.75 now at 10:43!  Thank you all so much!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* all three of my camera batteries are dead, so I&amp;#39;m going to recharge one before I leave.  Til then, no more kitty pictures, but I have tons more I could upload to imgur. =)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://this_doesn&amp;#x27;t_go_anywhere_stop_clicking_me.com\"&gt;Paypal link taken down&lt;/a&gt;; thanks to everyone in advance!  Seriously, the generosity of this site never ceases to astound me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I freakin&amp;#39; love you, redditors.  A lot of people have offered to chip in for the surgery, so I called the veterinary clinic to see if I could set up an account for credit to pay for the surgery, but they&amp;#39;re currently only open for emergency services, so I was told to call back on Monday when the staff who deal with billing are in.  &lt;a href=\"http://this_doesn&amp;#x27;t_go_anywhere_stop_clicking_me.com\"&gt;Until then,  Paypal link taken down&lt;/a&gt;.  Thank you again to everybody!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who are curious, here&amp;#39;s the vet clinic I went to last night (and the service was great, despite the poor reviews):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/place?oe=utf-8&amp;amp;q=town+and+country+vet+christiansburg&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;hq=town+and+country+vet&amp;amp;hnear=Christiansburg,+VA&amp;amp;cid=17086377072948266377\"&gt;Town &amp;amp; Country Veterinary Clinic&lt;br/&gt;\n1605 N Franklin St, Christiansburg, VA 24073-1401&lt;br/&gt;\n(540) 382-5042&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://tcvccares.com\"&gt;tcvccares.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;original post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://zargathe.imgur.com/buster_cat\"&gt;Here are some images&lt;/a&gt;, but I warn you, the last few images of his arm is gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say [almost-]3-pawed, as the kitten&amp;#39;s front right arm is mangled beyond repair; the bones are shattered and visible in the open wound, which is obviously infected and oozing.  In spite of this, he&amp;#39;s been walking on it for at least a month and a half, so it&amp;#39;s flattened, blackened, and just really, really bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I first saw this kitten what I assume is its sibling \u2014 around early august, and I&amp;#39;ve been putting food out for him for a couple weeks.  My girlfriend, a friend of ours, and I saw this kitten yesterday evening sitting by a dumpster, looking pathetic.  I parked my car and got some cat food and a paper plate out I had in my car, and put it out for him.  He was obviously uncomfortable by my being there and wouldn&amp;#39;t approach the food (near me, about 5 feet away from him), so I walked away\u2026 to the other side of the fence containing the dumpster area.  I then saw this kitten inhaling the food, and the other one come out from under a bush on the other side of the fence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I actually got to see the broken arm close enough to get a real feel for how bad it actually is\u2026 and I remembered &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/comments/c9dp2/i_found_this_kitten_last_night_his_tail_is_broken/\"&gt;kita&amp;#39;s post about 3 months ago about Mailbox and his mangled/infected tail&lt;/a&gt;, in particular this line:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We took him in to the vet. They said we brought him just in time, his tail was badly infected and was getting maggots. The tail is being amputated as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided that we had to help at least this kitten, but I&amp;#39;d try to keep the two of them together.  So, the kitten with the broken arm was very easy to catch, not just because he&amp;#39;s handicapped, but because he was just lying in a little hollow under a bush, and he didn&amp;#39;t really mind getting caught.  The other kitten ran away, and we weren&amp;#39;t able to catch it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We took the kitten to an emergency veterinary clinic where they told us that the arm is broken in many places (he may have gotten it caught on something or hit by a car), and since it&amp;#39;s already badly infected, operating on it is very unlikely to be successful.  He&amp;#39;s about 12 weeks old now, but is very skinny.  Apparently if I hadn&amp;#39;t been feeding him, he wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to survive.  His arm isn&amp;#39;t immediately life-threatening, so he&amp;#39;s going back on Monday for the amputation during regular business hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, now this will leave me with a tripod kitten that has become very affectionate to people which I can&amp;#39;t keep, as my roommate [whose parents own the place] is allergic to cats and prohibits them being in the apartment, along with a $150 bill I charged last night and a $400 - $600 bill on Monday which I really can&amp;#39;t afford.  I know I brought it upon myself, so I&amp;#39;m doing what I can to find a way to pay/see if other veterinary clinics can do the surgery for less, but what I&amp;#39;d really like to find is someone who can take him in.  Again, keeping the two kittens together would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, is there anyone in or around Blacksburg, VA who would like to take in a tripod kitten and maybe its sibling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**update 5**\u2026\n\n[\u2026is over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/djtgn/buster_the_soontobe_tripod_kitty_update/).\n\n**update 4**\n\nA little after 4 AM, and I am yet again\u2026 I don't even know what the word is.

Til then, no more kitty pictures, but I have tons more I could upload to imgur. =)\n\n**update 2**\n\n[Paypal link taken down](http://this_doesn't_go_anywhere_stop_clicking_me.com); thanks to everyone in advance!  Seriously, the generosity of this site never ceases to astound me!\n\n**update**\n\nI freakin' love you, redditors.  A lot of people have offered to chip in for the surgery, so I called the veterinary clinic to see if I could set up an account for credit to pay for the surgery, but they're currently only open for emergency services, so I was told to call back on Monday when the staff who deal with billing are in.  [Until then,  Paypal link taken down](http://this_doesn't_go_anywhere_stop_clicking_me.com).  Thank you again to everybody!  \n\nFor those who are curious, here's the vet clinic I went to last night (and the service was great, despite the poor reviews):\n\n[Town &amp; Country Veterinary Clinic  \n1605 N Franklin St, Christiansburg, VA 24073-1401  \n(540) 382-5042](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?oe=utf-8&amp;q=town+and+country+vet+christiansburg&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=town+and+country+vet&amp;hnear=Christiansburg,+VA&amp;cid=17086377072948266377)  \n[tcvccares.com](http://tcvccares.com)\n\n**original post**\n\n[Here are some images](http://zargathe.imgur.com/buster_cat), but I warn you, the last few images of his arm is gruesome.\n\nI say [almost-]3-pawed, as the kitten's front right arm is mangled beyond repair; the bones are shattered and visible in the open wound, which is obviously infected and oozing.  In spite of this, he's been walking on it for at least a month and a half, so it's flattened, blackened, and just really, really bad.\n\nThat's when I first saw this kitten what I assume is its sibling \u2014 around early august, and I've been putting food out for him for a couple weeks.  My girlfriend, a friend of ours, and I saw this kitten yesterday evening sitting by a dumpster, looking pathetic.  I parked my car and got some cat food and a paper plate out I had in my car, and put it out for him.  He was obviously uncomfortable by my being there and wouldn't approach the food (near me, about 5 feet away from him), so I walked away\u2026 to the other side of the fence containing the dumpster area.  I then saw this kitten inhaling the food, and the other one come out from under a bush on the other side of the fence.\n\nThis was the first time I actually got to see the broken arm close enough to get a real feel for how bad it actually is\u2026 and I remembered [kita's post about 3 months ago about Mailbox and his mangled/infected tail](http://www.reddit.com/comments/c9dp2/i_found_this_kitten_last_night_his_tail_is_broken/), in particular this line:\n\n&gt;We took him in to the vet. They said we brought him just in time, his tail was badly infected and was getting maggots. The tail is being amputated as we speak.\n\nI decided that we had to help at least this kitten, but I'd try to keep the two of them together.  So, the kitten with the broken arm was very easy to catch, not just because he's handicapped, but because he was just lying in a little hollow under a bush, and he didn't really mind getting caught.  The other kitten ran away, and we weren't able to catch it.\n\nWe took the kitten to an emergency veterinary clinic where they told us that the arm is broken in many places (he may have gotten it caught on something or hit by a car), and since it's already badly infected, operating on it is very unlikely to be successful.  He's about 12 weeks old now, but is very skinny.  Apparently if I hadn't been feeding him, he wouldn't have been able to survive.  His arm isn't immediately life-threatening, so he's going back on Monday for the amputation during regular business hours.\n\nSo, now this will leave me with a tripod kitten that has become very affectionate to people which I can't keep, as my roommate [whose parents own the place] is allergic to cats and prohibits them being in the apartment, along with a $150 bill I charged last night and a $400 - $600 bill on Monday which I really can't afford.  I know I brought it upon myself, so I'm doing what I can to find a way to pay/see if other veterinary clinics can do the surgery for less, but what I'd really like to find is someone who can take him in.  Again, keeping the two kittens together would be ideal.\n\n**So, is there anyone in or around Blacksburg, VA who would like to take in a tripod kitten and maybe its sibling?**", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "ditev", "from_kind": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zargathe", "media": null, "score": 848, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 476, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "hide_score": false, "edited": true, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "stickied": false, "from": null, "is_self": true, "from_id": null, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/ditev/for_the_past_month_and_a_half_ive_seen_this/?ref=search_posts", "locked": false, "name": "t3_ditev", "created": 1285468036.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ditev/for_the_past_month_and_a_half_ive_seen_this/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "For the past month and a half I've seen this [almost-]3-pawed kitten hobbling around my apartment parking lot.
